## Applications of Data Science in Mental Health 

Mental illness is an extremely prevalent health issue today, spanning across all ages and demographics. It is especially important to note that many chronic mental illnesses are found in a large percentage of adolescents. Currently, less than half of people with some type of mental illness receive treatment. This issue is likely due a variety of factors, namely the negative stigma surrounding mental health, the costs associated with treatment, and the limited access to resources. Further, the use of data science in this field has so far been relatively limited. However, there is much potential for it to grow, as data science methods could be used to quantify the effects mental illness have had and will have in the future on both US and global populations. Hopefully, this research could be used to provide further justification for more resources to be allocated to treatment for mental illnesses and research. 

Although data science is not largely utilized in the field of mental health, there are numerous specific instances where it has proven to be very insightful. For example, machine learning has started to be used to interpret large groups of data to discern patterns in the causes and signs of mental illness, while also providing the most effective course of treatment. In identifying specific causes, researchers in the future could implement and educate the public on measures that prevent mental illness. Even so, the algorithms that perform this task are continually adjusted, and therefore are not widely utilized.

Regardless of the narrow applications of data science in mental health, machine learning still has its benefits in the field. In suicide prevention, crisis centers and hotlines employ machine learning to identify who may be at a high risk of committing suicide or self harm based soley on the language used by the caller. Throughout the day, these centers are collecting data about the calls received which will ensure the proper resources are available to those who need them. This data also helps counselors determine which callers may need assistance outside of the scope of the center and recognize which questions are appropriate to ask callers. Thus, data science can be implemented in these centers and hotlines to better direct those in need of mental health support to the proper professional help.

In conclusion, machine learning and data analysis can significantly improve the field of mental health by providing a more in-depth understanding of the causes, along with more access to mental health resources. Presently, there is significant research into more uses in mental health as data is collected and algorithms are refined. The goal of this research will be to hopefully allow medical professionals to be more adept at identifying, treating, and preventing mental illness. If mental health diagnoses are improved, those suffering from these disorders will have more fitting treatments. As a result, more developments in AI, machine learning, and data analysis techniques will ultimately allow data scientists to more accurately test learnings that will aid in the promotion of mental health.
