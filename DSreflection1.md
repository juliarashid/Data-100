## The Applications of Machine Learning to The Field of Orthodontics 

The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and dental fields has significantly expanded over the last decade. This growth is especially prevalent and necessary in developing countries that lack the necessary physicians and equipment required to properly aid patients. AI software proves to be very beneficial in these areas, cutting down cost and error. Overall, the digitalization of health fields will eventually allow for a more equitable system of medical and dental attention, especially for those in countries without vital healthcare resources. 

In the field of dentistry, digitalization technology has expanded in hopes of reducing infection that can destroy the jaw (periodontitis), as well as death attributed to oral and maxillofacial diseases. More specifically, the field of orthodontics has presented new opportunities for the expansion of machine learning and artificial neuronal networks. It is often difficult to come to a certain conclusion about extracting teeth, as physicianâ€™s solutions vary depending on knowledge and experience. To solve this issue, an AI expert system has been refined to determine the need for extraction using the back-propagation algorithm and neuronal networks. Despite the limited extent of this study, its success and accuracy compared to other diagnostic tools proves that the field of orthodontics may benefit from expert systems with machine learning in neuronal networks. The implementation of this system would aid newer physicians with limited experience as well, allowing them to more accustomed to the field.

Despite the great benefit that the execution of many clinical decision support systems would bring to clinicians, many of these systems have only been tested in limited sample sizes, typically due to the high cost of experimentation. However, there are numerous difficulties that would need to be addressed in order to implement these systems intoto the broader field of dentistry. One challenge is that there are few dentists that specialize one field. So, a clinical decision support system would need to accommodate for the generalization of the field of dentistry, covering a wide range of areas. Overall, the digitalization of the medical and dental field is a rapidly growing, and will eventually prove to be extremely mutually beneficial to both patient and physician.
