Hi, I'm Julia! I'm from the Vienna/Oakton area of Northern Virginia, and I intend to major in Neuroscience and Hispanic Studies on the pre-dental track. In terms of school, I love all math or science related topics, and specifically I enjoy learning about behavior and personality. Outside of school, I like to read any genre of book, to work out, and to take my dog on long walks.
