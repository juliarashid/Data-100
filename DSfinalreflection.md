## Data Science and The Understanding of Human Behavior

The world of data science has applications in almost every aspect of modern day life, from the apps we mindlessly scroll through, to the television shows we binge for hours. In any field, data science brings significant insight and has already proven to be invaluable. Specifically, the advent of data science has brought numerous advancements in the way we perceive and understand human behavior and development in terms of mental health initiatives and treatment of psychiatric disorders. In both fields, data science is rapidly progressing, allowing us to regard human development processes in a new light. 

Mental health over recent years has slowly come into the circle of widely discussed topics with a growing importance. One large issue in this field is that many people with mental illness are unable to receive treatment due to a wide range of factors, but mostly due to the negative stigma surrounding mental health. Hopefully, data science could be one solution in decreasing the taboo in talking about mental illness and challenges by offering a more comprehensive understanding of risk factors and causes, along with providing more confidential forms of resources and support. For example, machine learning is readily being used in crisis centers to identify callers who might be at higher risk of committing harm to themselves or others. This is done by collecting large sets of data, allowing researchers to identify patterns and subsequently provide the most fitting resources and support. These prediction models could potentially serve to improve the treatment people with mental illness receive in a more private manner, and also could prevent mental illness from developing in the first place.

Another field with growing applications for data science is psychometrics and the classification of psychological disorders. Exploratory data analysis and artificial neural networks are an improved approach to the psychopathological diagnosis of patients, providing in-depth information on the characteristics of these patients and their disorders. Further, artificial neural networks could also play a role in predicting the diagnosis of a patient based on responses from a questionnaire, while simultaneously highlighting the most indicative answers. Thus, data science methods can be used to create predictive models that aid in the replication and generalization of data that aid in the understanding of complex psychiatric disorders.

However, there are significant obstacles in the use of data science in the fields of mental health and in understanding psychiatric disorders. In both realms, there is risk of the oversimplification of data, as it is feasible for a machine learning method to only report the best model. This could potentially serve to harm in that patients may counterintuitively receive inadequate treatment, diagnosis, or resources. Analyzing human behavior is an extremely multifaceted task, and it is worth considering if it should be generalized using data science methods. Ultimately, data science will serve to improve the human condition by allowing for a more detailed and thorough analysis and interpretation of behavior.
